## What is Sphenery?

Sphenery is an experimental code-first framework written in [Beef](https://beeflang.org) for creating applications and games.
Sphenery is inspired by other frameworks like XNA, MonoGame, and Ultraviolet.
The goal is to provide the basis for game-like applications in a modular fashion.

## Note

Sphenery is in the very early stages of development. Absolutely any and everything is subject to change.
